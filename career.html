    <section>
      <h2>Company 1: Morgan Stanley</h2>
      <p>Contact: Morgan Stanley Recruiting — 1585 Broadway, New York, NY 10036 — recruiting@ms.com</p>
      <p>Why I like it: I really like Morgan Stanley because it’s one of the top companies in finance and offers great programs for new analysts. The job is all about helping clients manage their money, invest wisely, and understand the markets. I’m drawn to that fast-paced, high-energy environment where I can learn about investment banking and wealth management from some of the best people in the industry.</p>
      <p>Why I'm qualified: I’ve taken finance classes that helped me understand how markets work and how to analyze data. I’ve also managed budgets in campus leadership roles, which gave me real experience with financial decision-making. I’m detail-oriented and good at breaking down numbers to find patterns or solutions.</p>

      <h2>Company 2: Investment Banking</h2>
      <p>Contact: Deloitte Careers — 456 Consulting Ave, Chicago, IL — careers@deloitte.com</p>
      <p>Why I like it: I’m interested in Deloitte because their investment banking and M&A work focuses on helping companies grow, merge, or restructure. I like the idea of working on big deals and seeing how financial strategies actually impact real businesses. The analyst programs and mentorship opportunities would give me a strong start in my finance career while letting me build real-world experience.</p>
      <p>Why I'm qualified: I’ve built a solid foundation through finance coursework and have strong analytical skills. I’ve also done well in fast-paced group settings where quick thinking and teamwork are key—skills that fit perfectly with investment banking work.</p>
